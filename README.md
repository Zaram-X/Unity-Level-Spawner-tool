# Unity Level Spawner Tool

A custom Unity Editor tool that lets you quickly spawn prefabs into your scene with control over position, randomization, and batch spawning.

## âœ¨ Features
- Drag and assign prefabs (Coin, Enemy, Platform, or any prefab).  
- Spawn prefabs at a specific position or at a selected objectâ€™s position.  
- Randomize spawn position within a chosen range.  
- Spawn multiple prefabs at once (batch spawning).  
- Undo support (so you can easily revert spawns).
